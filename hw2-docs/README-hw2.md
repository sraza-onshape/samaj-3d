## How to Reproduce Results 

1. Make a virtual environment with Python. I've tested the following with Python 3.11:
```bash
$ python3 -m venv env  # environment setup - virtualenv
$ source env/bin/activate
(env) $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. The code is written in a Jupyter notebook. Please [add the virtual you just created as a Jupyter kernel](https://janakiev.com/blog/jupyter-virtual-envs/), so you can use it to run the code.

```bash
$ python -m ipykernel install --name=env
```

1. Finally, you can navigate to `src/experiments_hw.ipynb` to run the code.


## Where to Find Stuff

1. `src/experiments_hw2.ipynb` - this is my report. I provide code and justifications thereof where appropiate.


1. `src/util` - this directory has a collection of my own helper functions, which I commonly use to complete assignments.

1. `generated-images/` - all the images created for problem 1 and 2.
